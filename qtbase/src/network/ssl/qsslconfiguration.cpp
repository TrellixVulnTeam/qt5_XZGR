/*!
    \class QSslConfiguration
    \brief The QSslConfiguration class holds the configuration and state of an SSL connection
    \since 4.4

    \reentrant
    \inmodule QtNetwork
    \ingroup network
    \ingroup ssl
    \ingroup shared

    QSslConfiguration is used by Qt networking classes to relay
    information about an open SSL connection and to allow the
    application to control certain features of that connection.

    The settings that QSslConfiguration currently supports are:

    \list
      \li The SSL/TLS protocol to be used
      \li The certificate to be presented to the peer during connection
         and its associated private key
      \li The ciphers allowed to be used for encrypting the connection
      \li The list of Certificate Authorities certificates that are
         used to validate the peer's certificate
    \endlist

    These settings are applied only during the connection
    handshake. Setting them after the connection has been established
    has no effect.

    The state that QSslConfiguration supports are:
    \list
      \li The certificate the peer presented during handshake, along
         with the chain leading to a CA certificate
      \li The cipher used to encrypt this session
    \endlist

    The state can only be obtained once the SSL connection starts, but
    not necessarily before it's done. Some settings may change during
    the course of the SSL connection without need to restart it (for
    instance, the cipher can be changed over time).

    State in QSslConfiguration objects cannot be changed.

    QSslConfiguration can be used with QSslSocket and the Network
    Access API.

    Note that changing settings in QSslConfiguration is not enough to
    change the settings in the related SSL connection. You must call
    setSslConfiguration on a modified QSslConfiguration object to
    achieve that. The following example illustrates how to change the
    protocol to TLSv1_0 in a QSslSocket object:

    \snippet code/src_network_ssl_qsslconfiguration.cpp 0

    \sa QSsl::SslProtocol, QSslCertificate, QSslCipher, QSslKey,
        QSslSocket, QNetworkAccessManager,
        QSslSocket::sslConfiguration(), QSslSocket::setSslConfiguration()
*/

/*!
    Constructs an empty SSL configuration. This configuration contains
    no valid settings and the state will be empty. isNull() will
    return true after this constructor is called.

    Once any setter methods are called, isNull() will return false.
